# au3miner

I have several computers in my mining farm and keeping the latest binaries deployed & constantly running is somewhat of a hassle: enter AutoIt.  I use AutoIt to compile an executable that contains all the portable mining binaries I need along with whatever rudimentary automation scripts I find useful--throw the single .exe onto a thumbdrive (or mega or somewhere similar), launch on my machines, ???, profit!
